Although Riak wasn't explicitly created as a document store, two
features recently added to Riak---[[Riak Search|Using Search]] and
[[Riak Data Types|Using Data Types]]---make it possible to use Riak as a

tutorial, we'll build a basic implementation of a document store using
[[Riak maps|Using Data Types#Maps]].

## Basic Approach

## Querying

## Creating an Interface
