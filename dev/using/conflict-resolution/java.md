For reasons explained in the [[introduction to conflict
resolution|Conflict Resolution]], we strongly recommend adopting a
conflict resolution strategy that requires applications to resolve
siblings according to use-case-specific criteria. Here, we'll provide a
brief guide to conflict resolution using the official [Riak Java
client](https://github.com/basho/riak-java-client).

## How the Java Client Handles Conflict Resolution

The official Riak Java client provides a `ConflictResolver` interface
that requires you to implement a `resolve` method that takes a Java
`List` of objects os a specific of type that are stored in Riak and
produces a single object of that type. In other words, a `resolve`
function must convert a `List<T>` into a single `T`. Here's an example
for the class `Foo`:

```java
import com.basho.riak.client.api.cap.ConflictResolver;

public class FooResolver implements ConflictResolver<Foo> {
    @Override
    public Foo resolve(List<Foo> siblings) {
        // Insert your sibling resolution logic here
    }
}
```

What happens within the `resolve` method is up to you and will always
depend on the use case at hand. In this tutorial, however, we'll provide
a simple example to get you started.

## Basic Conflict Resolution Example

Let's say that we're building a social network application and storing
lists of usernames representing each user's "friends." Each user will
bear the class `User`, which we'll create below. All of the data for our
application will be stored in buckets that bear the [[bucket type|Using
Bucket Types]] `siblings`, and for this bucket type `allow_mult` is set
to `true`, which means that Riak will generate siblings in certain
cases---siblings that our application will need to be equipped to
resolve when they arise.

The question that we need to ask ourselves at this point is the
following: if a given user has conflict lists, which list should be
deemed more "correct?" What criteria should be applied? Should the lists
be merged? Should we pick a list at random and deem that correct? We'll
keep it simple here and say that the following criterion will hold: if
multiple conflict lists exist, _the longer list will be the one that our
application deems correct_. While this might not make sense in
real-world applications, it's a good jumping-off point.

### Creating our Data Class

We'll start by creating a `User` class for each user's data. Each `User`
object will consist of a `friends` property that lists the usernames, as
strings, of the user's friends.

```java
public class User {
    public List<String> friends;

    public User(List<String> friends) {
        this.friends = friends;
    }
}
```

Here's an example of instantiating a new `User` object:

```java
List<String> friends = new LinkedList<String>();
friends.add("fred");
User bashobunny = new User(friends);
```

### Implementing a Conflict Resolution Interface

So what happens if siblings are present and the user `bashobunny` has
different friend lists in different object replicas? For that we can
implement the `ConflictResolver` class described [[above|Conflict
Resolution: Java#How-the-Java-Client-Handles-Conflict-Resolution]]. We
need to implement that interface in a way that is specific to the need
at hand, i.e. taking a list of `User` objects and returning the `User`
object that has the longest `friends` list:

```java
import com.basho.riak.client.api.cap.ConflictResolver;

public class UserResolver implements ConflictResolver<User> {
    @Override
    public User resolve(List<User> siblings) {
        // If there are no objects present, return null
        if (siblings.size == 0) {
            return null;
        // If there is only one User object present, return that object
        } else if (siblings.size == 1) {
            return siblings.get(0);
        // And if there are multiple User objects, return the object
        // with the longest list
        } else {
        int longestList = 0;
        User userWithLongestList;

        // Iterate through the User objects to check for the longest
        // list
        for (User user : siblings) {
            if (user.friends.size > longestList) {
                userWithLongestList = user;
                longestList = user.friends.size;
            } else {
                return siblings.get(0);
            }
        }
        return userWithLongestList;
    }
}
```

### Registering a Conflict Resolver Class

To use a conflict resolver, we must register it:

```java
ConflictResolverFactory factory = ConflictResolverFactory.getInstance();
ConflictResolver<User> userResolver = factory.getConflictResolver(new UserResolver());
```

With the resolver registered, the resolution logic that we have created
resolve siblings automatically upon read. Registering a custom conflict
resolver can occur at any point in the application's lifecycle and will
be applied on all reads that involve that object type.

## Conflict Resolution and Writes

In the above example, we created a conflict resolver that resolves a list
of discrepant `User` objects and returns a single `User`. It's important
to note, however, that this resolver will only provide the application
with a single "correct" value; it will _not_ write that value back to
Riak. That requires a separate step. One way to do that would be to
modify the `UserResolver` class that we created above to also include a
step that stores the `User` object with the longest `friends` list.
Below is an example:

```java
public class UserResolver implements ConflictResolver<User> {
    @Override
    public User resolve(List<User> siblings) {
    if (siblings.size == 0) {
        return null;
    } else if (siblings.size == 1) {
        return siblings.get(0);
    } else {
        int longestList = 0;
        User userWithLongestList;

        for (User user : siblings) {
            if (user.friends.size > longestList) {
                userWithLongestList = user;
                longestList = user.friends.size;
            } else {
                return siblings.get(0);
            }
            storeUser(userWithLongestList);
            return userWithLongestList;
        }
    }

    public void storeUser(User user, Location location) throws Exception {
        StoreValue storeOp = new StoreValue.Builder(user)
                .withLocation(location)
                .build();
        client.execute(storeOp.build());
    }
}
```

Now our resolver will both return a single `User` object to the
application for further use _and_ notify Riak which value the
application takes to be correct.

The bad news is that this operation may still create siblings, for
example if the write is performed simultaneously with another write. The
good news, however, is that that is perfectly okay.  Our application is
now designed to gracefully handle siblings whenever they are
encountered, and the resolution logic we choose will now be applied
automatically every time.
