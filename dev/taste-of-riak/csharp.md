If you haven't set up a Riak Node and started it, please visit the [[Prerequisites|Taste of Riak: Prerequisites]] first.

To try this flavor of Riak, a working installation of the .NET Framework or Mono is required. 

### Client Setup

Install [the Riak .NET Client](https://github.com/basho/riak-dotnet-client/wiki/Installation) through [NuGet](http://nuget.org/packages/RiakClient) or the Visual Studio NuGet package manager.

<div class="note">
<div class="title">Configuring for a remote cluster</div>
By default, the Riak .NET Client will add a section to your `app.config` file for a four node local cluster. If you are using a remote cluster, open up `app.config` and change the `hostAddress` values to point to nodes in your remote cluster.
</div>

### Connecting to Riak

Connecting to Riak with the Riak .NET Client requires creating a cluster object and then creating a new client object.

```csharp
using System;
using RiakClient;

namespace TasteOfRiak
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
        	// don't worry, we'll use this string later
	        const string contributors = "contributors";
            IRiakEndpoint cluster = RiakCluster.FromConfig("riakConfig");
            IRiakClient client = cluster.CreateClient();
        }
    }
}
```

This creates a new `RiakCluster` which is used to create a new `RiakClient`. A `RiakCluster` object handles all the details of tracking active nodes and also provides load balancing. The `RiakClient` is used to send commands to Riak. *Note:* the `IRiakEndpoint` object implements `IDisposable` and should be correctly disposed when you're done communicating with Riak.

Let's make sure the cluster is online. Add this to your `Main` method:

```csharp
var pingResult = client.Ping();

if (pingResult.IsSuccess)
{
    Console.WriteLine("pong");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Are you sure Riak is running?");
    Console.WriteLine("{0}: {1}", pingResult.ResultCode, pingResult.ErrorMessage);
}
```

This is some simple code to test that a node in a Riak cluster is online - we send a simple ping message. Even if the cluster isn't present, the Riak .NET Client will return a response message. It's important to check that your activity was successful by using the `IsSuccess` property and then checking any errors and result codes.

### Saving Objects to Riak

Pinging a Riak cluster sounds like a lot of fun, but eventually someone is going to want us to do productive work. Let's create a class to represent some data and save some objects into Riak.

The Riak .NET Client makes use of a `RiakObject` class to encapsulate Riak key/value objects. At the most basic, a `RiakObject` is responsible for identifying your object and for translating it into a format that can be easily saved to Riak.

Add the `RiakClient.Models` namespace to your using directive. Your usings should look like this:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using RiakClient;
using RiakClient.Models;
```

Add the `Person` class to the `TasteOfRiak` namespace:

```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string EmailAddress { get; set; }
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
}
```

Now let's create some people!

```csharp
var people = new[]
{
    new Person {
        EmailAddress = "bashoman@basho.com",
        FirstName = "Basho",
        LastName = "Man"
    },
    new Person {
        EmailAddress = "johndoe@gmail.com",
        FirstName = "John",
        LastName = "Doe"
    }
};

foreach (var person in people)
{
    var o = new RiakObject(contributors, person.EmailAddress, person);
    var putResult = client.Put(o);

    if (putResult.IsSuccess)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Successfully saved {1} to bucket {0}", o.Key, o.Bucket);
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Are you *really* sure Riak is running?");
        Console.WriteLine("{0}: {1}", putResult.ResultCode, putResult.ErrorMessage);
    }
}
```

In this sample, we create a collection of `Person` objects and then save each `Person` to Riak. 

Before saving, we need to create a `RiakObject` that encapsulates the bucket, key, and object to be saved. Once we've created a `RiakObject` from our `Person` object, we can save it to Riak using `Client.Put()`.

Once again, we check the response from Riak. If things are successful, you'll see a helpful message letting you know that your object has been saved to Riak. If things didn't go as planned, there will be an error message displaying the result code and a helpful error message.

### Reading from Riak

Let's find a person!

```csharp
var result = client.Get(contributors, "bashoman@basho.com");
if (result.IsSuccess)
{
    bashoman = result.Value.GetObject<Person>();
    Console.WriteLine("I found {0} in {1}", bashoman.EmailAddress, contributors);
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Something went wrong!");
    Console.WriteLine("{0}: {1}", result.ResultCode, result.ErrorMessage);
}
```

We use `RiakClient.Get` to retrieve an object from Riak. This returns a `RiakResult<RiakObject>` which, like other RiakResults, helpfully encapsulates the communication with Riak.

After verifying that we've been able to communicate with Riak *and* that we have a successful result, we use `GetObject<T>` to deserialize our object. 

### Modifying Existing Data

Let's say that Basho Man has decided to be known as Riak Man:

```csharp
bashoman.FirstName = "Riak";

var o = new RiakObject(contributors, bashoman.EmailAddress, bashoman);
var updateResult = client.Put(o);
if (updateResult.IsSuccess)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Successfully updated {0} in {1}", bashoman.EmailAddress, contributors);
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Something went wrong!");
    Console.WriteLine("{0}: {1}", updateResult.ResultCode, updateResult.ErrorMessage);
}
```

Updating an object involves creating a new `RiakObject` then using `RiakClient.Put` to save the existing object. 

### Deleting Data

```csharp
var deleteResult = client.Delete(contributors, "johndoe@gmail.com");
if (deleteResult.IsSuccess)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Successfully got rid of John Doe");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Something went wrong!");
    Console.WriteLine("{0}: {1}", deleteResult.ResultCode, deleteResult.ErrorMessage);
}
```

Just like other operations, we check the results that have come back from Riak to make sure the object was successfully deleted. Of course, if you don't care about that, you can just ignore the result.

The Riak .NET Client has a lot of additional functionality that makes it easy to build rich, complex applications with Riak. Check out the [documentation](https://github.com/basho/riak-dotnet-client/wiki) to learn more about working with the Riak .NET Client and Riak.

## Next Steps

More complex use cases can be composed from these initial create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations. [[In the next chapter|Taste of Riak: Querying]], we will look at how to store and query more complicated and interconnected data, such as documents.
