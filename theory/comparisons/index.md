The NoSQL space, as well as the database space in general, is growing more and more crowded. Because of this, we often find ourselves answering very high-level questions from developers, prospects, and customers along along the following lines: How does Riak compare to this database? What is the main difference between your replication strategy and this NoSQL Database?

In light of these kinds of questions, we thought it would be worthwhile to write very brief and objective comparisons to as many databases as possible.

* [[Riak Compared to Cassandra]]
* [[Riak Compared to Couchbase]]
* [[Riak Compared to CouchDB]]
* [[Riak Compared to HBase]]
* [[Riak Compared to MongoDB]]
* [[Riak Compared to Neo4j]]
* [[Riak Compared to DynamoDB]]

**Disclaimer**: Data storage software is complicated and it changes rapidly, and we do the best we can to keep up with changes in the NoSQL space. If you think that we've made an error, please kindly correct us and we would be happy to make the change.

## Slide Decks

This is a sample of the slide decks used in presentations given by Riak developers and developer advocates and members of the Riak Community at conferences, meetups, and various other events worldwide. If you have a Slide Deck to add, please fork the Riak Docs repo [on GitHub](https://github.com/basho/basho_docs) and do so.
