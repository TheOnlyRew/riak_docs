The NoSQL space, as well as the database space in general, is growing
more and more crowded. Because of this, we often find ourselves
answering very high-level questions from developers, prospects, and
customers along the following lines:

* How does Riak compare to this database?
* What is the main difference between this database's replication strategy and that of Riak?
* Which APIs are available in both systems?
* How does each system handle scaling, concurrency, and multi-datacenter replication?
* Which data models are supported by each system?

In light of these kinds of questions, we thought it would be worthwhile
to write very brief and objective comparisons to as many databases as
possible.

* [[Riak Compared to Couchbase]]
* [[Riak Compared to CouchDB]]
* [[Riak Compared to HBase]]
* [[Riak Compared to MongoDB]]
* [[Riak Compared to Neo4j]]
* [[Riak Compared to DynamoDB]]

Data storage software is complicated and changes rapidly. We do the best
we can to keep up with changes in the NoSQL space, but if you think that
we've made an error, please kindly <a href="https://github.com/basho/basho_docs/issues/new">submit an issue</a>
or notify us at <strong>docs@basho.com</strong> and we would be happy to
make any changes.

## Slide Decks

Below is a sample of the slide decks used in presentations given by Riak
developers and developer advocates and members of the Riak Community at
conferences, meetups, and various other events worldwide. If you have a
slide deck to add, please fork the Riak Docs repo [on GitHub](https://github.com/basho/basho_docs)
and do so.

* [Choosing the Right NoSQL Database](http://www.slideshare.net/juokaz/choosing-the-right-nosql-database-4developers) --- A whirlwind tour of a few NoSQL solutions, discussing the very different ways that they represent data and showcasing their unique strengths and weaknesses in various kinds of applications, as well as an overview of how new technologies can help to address today's scaling challenges and what compromises must be made when leaving behind older systems.
* [Rolling with Riak](http://www.slideshare.net/johnthethird/rolling-with-riak) --- Overview of Riak's NoSQL distributed key/value data store by John Lynch from Rigel Group.
* [How Does Riak Compare to Cassandra?](http://www.slideshare.net/ukd1/how-does-riak-compare-to-cassandra-cassandra-london-user-group-july-2011) --- A presentation about Riak and a quick comparison to Cassandra. Originally presented at the Cassandra London User Group in July 2011.
