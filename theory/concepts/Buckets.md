Buckets are used to define a virtual keyspace for storing Riak objects.
They enable you to define non-default configurations over that keyspace
concerning [[replication properties]] and [[other
parameters|Buckets#configuration]].

In certain respects, buckets can be compared to tables in relational
databases or folders in filesystems, respectively. From the standpoint
of performance, buckets with default configurations are essentially
"free," while non-default configurations, defined [[using bucket
types]], will be gossiped around [[the ring|Clusters#the-ring]] using
Riak's [[cluster metadata]] subsystem.

## Configuration

Bucket configurations are defined [[using bucket types]], which enables
you to create and modify sets of configurations and apply them to as
many buckets as you wish. With bucket types, you can configure the
following bucket-level parameters, overriding the default values if you
wish.

#### allow_mult

Determines whether sibling values can be created. See [[siblings|Causal
Context#Siblings]]. The default can be `true` or `false` depending on
the context. See the documentation on [[`allow_mult` in Riak 2.0|Using
Bucket Types#bucket-types-and-the-allow_mult-setting]] for more
information.

#### n_val

Specifies the number of copies of each object to be stored in the
cluster. See the documentation on [[replication properties]]. Default:
`3`.

#### last_write_wins

Indicates if an object's timestamp will be used to decide the canonical
write in the case of a conflict. See the documentation on [[vector
clocks]] and on [[conflict resolution]] for more information. Default:
`false`.

#### r, pr, w, dw, pw, rw, notfound_ok, basic_quorum

See the documentation on [[replication properties]] for more information
on all of these properties.

#### precommit

A list of Erlang functions to be executed before writing an object. See
our documentation on [[pre-commit hooks|Using Commit
Hooks#pre-commit-hooks]] for more information. Default: no pre-commit
hooks, i.e. an empty list.

#### postcommit

A list of Erlang functions to be executed after writing an object. See
our documentation on [[post-commit hooks|Using Commit
Hooks#post-commit-hooks]] for more information. Default: no post-commit
hooks, i.e. an empty list.

#### old_vclock, young_vclock, small_vclock, big_vclock

These settings enable you to manage [[vector clock pruning|Conflict
Resolution#Vector-Clock-Pruning]].

#### backend

If you are using the [[Multi]] backend, this property enables you to
determine which of Riak's available backends---[[Bitcask]], [[LevelDB]],
or [[Memory]]---will be used in buckets of this type. If you are using
LevelDB, Bitcask, or the Memory backend at a cluster-wide level, _all_
buckets of all types will use the assigned backend.

#### consistent

If you wish to use Riak's [[strong consistency]] feature for buckets
bearing a type, this setting must be set to `true`. The default is
`false`. More information can be found in our documentation on [[using
strong consistency]].

#### datatype

If you are using [[Riak Data Types|Using Data Types]], this setting
determines [[which data type|Using Data
Types#setting-up-buckets-to-use-riak-data-types]] will be used in
buckets of this bucket type. Possible values: `counter`, `set`, or
`map`.

#### dvv_enabled

Whether [[dotted version vectors|Causal Context#Dotted-Version-Vectors]]
will be used instead of traditional [[vector clocks|Causal
Context#Vector-Clocks]] for [[conflict resolution]]. Default: `false`.

#### chash_keyfun, linkfun

These settings involve features that have been deprecated. You will not
need to adjust these values.

## Fetching Bucket Properties

If you'd like to see how a particular bucket has been configured, you
can do so using our official client libraries or through Riak's [[HTTP
API]]. The following would fetch the properties for the bucket
`animals` if that bucket had a default configuration, i.e. the `default`
bucket type:

```java
Namespace animalsBucket = new Namespace("animals");
FetchBucketProperties fetchProps =
    new FetchBucketProperties.Builder(animalsBucket).build();
FetchBucketProperties.Response response = client.execute(fetchProps);
BucketProperties props = response.getProperties();
```

```ruby
bucket = client.bucket('animals')
bucket.properties
```

```python
bucket = client.bucket('animals')
bucket.get_properties()
```

```erlang
{ok, Props} = riakc_pb_socket:get_bucket(Pid, <<"animals">>).
```

```curl
# Assuming that Riak is running on "localhost" and port 8087:

curl http://localhost:8087/types/default/buckets/animals/props
```

If the bucket `animals` had a different type that you had created and
activated, e.g. `my_custom_type`, you could fetch the bucket properties
like so:

```java
Namespace customTypedBucket = new Namespace("my_custom_type", "animals");
FetchBucketProperties fetchProps =
    new FetchBucketProperties.Builder(customTypedBucket).build();
FetchBucketProperties.Response response = client.execute(fetchProps);
BucketProperties props = response.getProperties();
```

```ruby
bucket = client.bucket_type('my_custom_type').bucket('animals')
bucket.properties
```

```python
bucket = client.bucket_type('my_custom_type').bucket('animals')
bucket.get_properties()
```

```erlang
{ok, Props} = riakc_pb_socket:get_bucket(Pid, {<<"my_custom_type">>, <<"animals">>}).
```

```curl
curl http://localhost:8087/types/my_custom_type/buckets/animals/props
```
