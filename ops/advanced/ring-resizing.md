The ring resizing feature in Riak 2.0 and greater enables Riak operators
to change the number of partitions in a Riak cluster's
[[ring|Clusters#The-Ring]] during normal operations, under load.

Previously, any Riak cluster was limited to having the number of
partitions specified in its configuration throughout its entire
lifespan. This number is determined by the `ring_size` parameter in the
newer, `riak.conf`-based configuration system and by
`ring_creation_size` in the older, `app.config`-based system. In order
to change the number of partitions previously, a separate cluster would
need to be spun up alongside the original cluster and the data migrated
between the two.

A ring resize operation can be useful in the following two cases:

1. If a cluster has been created with either too few or too many
   partitions
2. If a cluster's capacity, in terms of the number of nodes, has changed
   in such a way that the optimal ring size has changed

You should consult our documentation on [[cluster capacity planning]]
before committing to a ring resize operation. Please note that there
is an important difference between changing the ring size and adding and
removing nodes. If you are looking to add or remove concurrent
processing ability to/from a cluster, you are advised to do so by
[[adding or removing nodes|Adding and Removing Nodes]].

## Feature Incompatibility

Ring resizing cannot be used in clusters using the following features:

* [[Riak Search 2.0|Using Search]]
* [[Strong consistency]]

In addition, ring resizing cannot be used in clusters using the
[[Multi-Datacenter Replication|Multi Data Center Replication v3
Architecture]] capabilities included with [Riak
Enterprise](http://basho.com/riak-enterprise/).

## Considerations Prior to Ring Resizing

There are a number of important considerations to bear in mind while
running a ring resizing process:

* For a resize to succeed, all nodes should be up. The only cluster
  operation permitted during a ring resize is `force-remove`. Other
  operations will be delayed while the resize completes.
* If you perform a [[listkeys|HTTP List Keys]] or [[secondary
  index|Using Secondary Indexes]] query during a ring resize, you may
  get duplicates or miscounts in coverage queries. In an upcoming
  release of Riak, this will be self-healing (see [this pull
  request](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/pull/685) for more
  information).
* Resizing partitions can take up a lot of disk space. Make sure that
  you have sufficient storage to complete the resize operation.
* Basho strongly recommends that you do _not_ use the `force-replace`
  command (part of the `[[riak-admin|riak-admin Command
  Line#cluster-force-replace]]` interface) during ring resizing.

<div class="note">
<div class="title">Note on ring resizing and strong consistency</div>
If you are using Riak's [[strong consistency]] feature, you will not be
able to perform a ring resize. This will, however, be supported in a
later version of Riak.
</div>

## Starting the Resize

To resize your Riak cluster, use the `riak-admin cluster` command
interface to `submit`, `plan`, and `commit` the change to your cluster.
The command to submit a resize request has the following form:

```bash
riak-admin cluster resize-ring <new_size>
```

The following command would schedule changing the size of the ring to
64:

```bash
riak-admin cluster resize-ring 64
```

If successful, the following would appear in the console:

```
Success: staged resize ring request with new size: 64
```

**Note**: The size of a Riak ring should _always_ be a 2<sup>n</sup>
integer, e.g. 16, 32, 64, etc.

Prior to committing any ring size-related changes, you will need to view
the planned changes using the `plan` command (as you would for any
cluster-wide changes):

```bash
riak-admin cluster plan
```

This will result in output along the following lines:

```
=============================== Staged Changes ================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
resize-ring    32 to 64 partitions

```

If you are satisfied with the changes, begin the resize operation by
committing the changes using the `commit` command:

```bash
riak-admin cluster commit
```

If successful, you should see the following in the console:

```
Cluster changes committed
```

If you change your mind prior to committing, you can abort the pending
changes using the `clear` command:

```bash
riak-admin cluster clear
```

<div class="note">
<div class="title">Note on cluster operations</div>
We do not recommend that you stage or commit other cluster operations
while a ring resize is in process. Although this is unadvisable, Riak
will allow you to commit other operations but will delay them until
after the resize has completed. The one exception to this is the
`[[force-replace|riak-admin Command Line#force-replace]]` command,
which will not be delayed. We also do not recommend this command due to
a [known issue](https://github.com/basho/basho_docs/pull/1285) that will
be addressed in a future release.

If a cluster-level change is necessary during a resize, we recommend
aborting the resize as described above, making the necessary change, and
then restarting the resize operation.

## Monitoring Resize Progress

With the new plan committed, the progress of the resize operation can
be monitored using the same means used to monitor other handoff
operations. You can use the `ring-status` command to view changes to the
cluster that are either in progress or queued:

```bash
riak-admin ring-status
```

Response:

```

```

You can also throttle the ring resize activity using `riak-admin
transfer-limit`, which will change the `handoff_concurrency` limit.

For the whole cluster:

```bash
riak-admin transfer-limit <limit>
```

For a specific node:

```bash
riak-admin transfer-limit <node> <limit>
```

Using `riak-admin transfers` will provide you more information about the
partitions that are currently in progress.

```bash
riak-admin transfers
```

Response:

```
'dev5@127.0.0.1' waiting to handoff 3 partitions
'dev4@127.0.0.1' waiting to handoff 1 partitions
'dev3@127.0.0.1' waiting to handoff 1 partitions
'dev2@127.0.0.1' waiting to handoff 2 partitions

You can confirm that the resize operation is no longer running using the
`transfers` command and verifying that there are no active or pending
transfers:

```
riak-admin transfers
```

Response:

```
No transfers active
```

You can also verify that there are the expected number of partitions in
the ring by opening the Erlang shell via the `[[riak attach|riak
Command Line#attach]]` command and running this snippet:

```erlang
length(riak_core_ring:all_owners(2, riak_core_ring_manager:get_my_ring())).
```

This command will return the number of partitions as an integer.

## Aborting a Ring Resize Already in Progress

The process to abort a currently running resize is very similar to the
process used to set one up. You must submit an `abort` request, plan it,
and commit it, all using the `riak-admin cluster` interface.

Submit an `abort` request:

```bash
riak-admin cluster resize-ring abort
```

One of the following messages will appear, depending on the outcome of
the `abort` request. If successful:

```
Success: staged abort resize ring request
```

If unsuccessful:

```
Failure: ring is not resizing or resize has completed
```

View planned changes:

```bash
riak-admin cluster plan
```

In the output, you should find something like the following:

```
Action         Details(s)
--------------------------------------
resize-ring    abort. current size: 128
```

Commit planned changes:

```bash
riak-admin cluster commit
```

If successful, you should see the following:

```bash
Cluster changes committed
```

If console output confirms that the changes have been committed, then
your resize operation has been successfully aborted.

## Secondary Indexes and MapReduce

If you are using [[secondary indexes (2i)|Using Secondary Indexes]] or
[[MapReduce|Using MapReduce]], there are some special steps that must be
undertaken on each node.

First, there is a Riak environment variable called
`fold_preflist_filter` that should be set to `true` on all nodes **prior
to the ring resize operation**. If you'd like to set that variable
without restarting the node, you can do so via the Erlang shell. To
access the shell, run `[[riak console|riak Command Line#console]]`; once
in the shell, you can set the variable using this command:

```erlang
application:set_env(riak_kv, fold_preflist_filter, true).
```

Once you have done this, however, you should also set the variable in
each node's `advanced.config` file so that new value of the variable is
registered any time the node restarts.

```advancedconfig
[
    {riak_kv, [
        %% ...
            {fold_preflist_filter, true},
        %% ...
    ]}
]
```

More information on setting parameters in `advanced.config` can be found
in our documentation on [[advanced configuration|Configuration
Files#Advanced-Configuration]].

The second step in preparing for a ring resize operation is to ensure
that coverage queries do not unnecessarily hinder the resize. This
means, first of all, that you should ensure that no [[list buckets|HTTP
List Buckets]] or [[list keys|HTTP List Keys]] operations whatsoever are
performed during the operation. While we do not recommend list buckets
or list keys in production in general, this is especially important
during ring resizing.

Second of all, please be aware that although ring resizing is compatible
with [[secondary index|Using Secondary Indexes]] queries, you should use
secondary index queries conservatively during ring resizing. We would
also like to remind you once again that ring resizing is incompatible
with [[Riak Search|Using Search]].
